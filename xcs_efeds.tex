% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We present the first comparison between properties of clusters of galaxies measured by the eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS) and the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope. An understanding of how measurements from the two telescopes differ is essential for the pursuit of joint analyses and direct comparisons, including those requiring scaling relations.
We have compared, in an ensemble fashion, properties from the eFEDS X-ray catalogue (542 candidates) with those from the Ultimate {\bf X}MM e{\bf X}traga{\bf L}actic (or XXL) survey project (100 clusters).
The eFEDS/XXL properties examined include the redshifts, X-ray temperatures ($T_{\rm X}$), and fractional $T_{\rm X}$ error ($T_{\rm X}$/$\Delta T_{\rm X}$) distributions. We find the distributions of redshift and $T_{\rm X}$ to be broadly similar between the two surveys, with a larger proportion of clusters above 4keV in the XXL-100-GC sample. However, the fractional $\Delta T_{\rm X}$ values are significantly larger in eFEDS compared to XXL.
We then construct a sample of 62 eFEDS X-ray cluster candidates that fall on an XMM observation, and visually inspect XMM, eROSITA, and SDSS images to remove candidates that should not be analysed. The final sample consists of 36 clusters, and we measure ${\sim}$24\% and ${\sim}$3\% contamination in the eFEDS X-ray and optically confirmed samples.
We then make direct comparisons of properties measured by eFEDS and by XMM for individual clusters using tools developed for the XMM Cluster Survey (XCS). Of our sample, 8 clusters have a $T_{\rm X}$ measured by both eROSITA and XMM, and we find and quantify an offset between the two instruments. This does not necessarily imply that there is something wrong with the eROSITA calibration: a similar offset between Chandra and XMM $T_{\rm X}$ values is well documented.
We compare 29 X-ray luminosities ($L_{\rm X}$) measured by eFEDS and XCS and find them to be in excellent agreement. This is very encouraging for future eROSITA based cosmological studies as their analyses will largely be based on luminosity scaling relations. We also construct $L_{\rm X}$ - $T_{\rm X}$ scaling relations based on eFEDS and XCS measurements, which are in significant tension. When a simple temperature calibration model is applied to XCS temperatures and a third scaling relation is measured, the tension is decreased, but the relations are still not wholly consistent.

\section{Introduction}
X-ray observations of clusters of galaxies provide insights into various aspects of astrophysics  \cite[e.g.,][]{,hitomi16turb,bhargava20,sanders21} and cosmology \cite[e.g.,][]{, vikhlinincosmo, otherxraycosmo}.
Clusters are among the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe and consist of a dark matter halo, the intra-cluster medium, and the component galaxies. The intra-cluster medium (ICM) is a high-temperature, low-density, plasma that emits strongly in the X-ray band, with both continuum and emission line components.

%, and we can extract information about its density, temperature, and composition through observations with X-ray telescopes.

There are no clusters in common between the two samples.}

%KR: not sure of the relevance of this paragraph
%It is also possible to derive the mass of a galaxy cluster from its X-ray emission, either directly through the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and the analysis of temperature and density radial profiles \citep[e.g.,][]{vikhlinin06,martino14,giles17}, or through the use of a scaling relation that takes us from an easier to measure quantity (such as a mean X-ray temperature/luminosity, or an optical richness) to an inferred mass \citep[e.g.,][]{efedsmor,xxlmt,arnaudmt}. Due to the difficulty of directly measuring galaxy cluster masses (using any method), these mass-observable relations (MORs) are essential for the derivation of cosmological parameters from galaxy cluster samples \citep[e.g.][]{desy1clusters}.

The eROSITA instrument mounted on the joint Russian-German Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission will contribute significantly to X-ray cluster astrophysics and cosmology. The final eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS) is predicted to detect approximately 100,000 galaxy clusters above a mass of $5\times10^{13}$h$^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$. All of these clusters will be accompanied with an X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$) measurement, and roughly 20\% \citep[][]{efedsclustercat} of the observations will yield an X-ray temperature ($T_{\rm X}$) measurement. However, except for a handful of the highest flux clusters, it will not be  possible to measure masses, via the hydrostatic technique, directly from eRASS data. Therefore, in order to maximise the scientific yield of the survey, it will be necessary to supplement the eRASS cluster catalogue with mass measurements from the current generation of X-ray telescopes (i.e. {\em XMM}, {\em Chandra}). {\em eROSITA} may be used for pointed observations after the all sky survey is complete, but they will not contribute to eRASS scientific analysis.
% detail not needed: with more than 50 soft band (0.5-2.0keV) counts up to $\rm{z}\sim1$ \citep{erass_numclusters}.
The aim of this paper is to explore potential synergies between eRASS cluster catalogues and the data in the {\em XMM}-Newton public archives, calibration considerations required for such analyses, and to demonstrate the fidelity of eFEDS measurements. For this we will make use of the recent release of the eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey \citep[eFEDS,][]{efedscat} and the {\em XMM} Cluster Survey \citep[][]{xcsfoundation}, as well as the XXL-100-GC catalogue \citep[][]{xxlgc100} to provide an indirect comparison to a similar X-ray survey.

% something for discussion, not intro: Interestingly, studies of clusters observed with both {\em XMM} and {\em Chandra}, has shown a significant difference between values of T$_{\rm{x}}$ measured for the same galaxy cluster.  This has led to functions to calibrate this observed temperature difference \citep[][]{xmmchandracal}, and any analysis which uses both XMM and Chandra temperatures typically accounts for this \citep[][]{farahixmmchandra,mikgasxmmchandra}.  
%not needed: The aim of this paper is to measure potential temperature differences between clusters detected in eFEDS, and those measure by {\em XMM}.

In \S\ref{sec:efedsproperties} we explore the general properties of the eFEDS cluster catalogue and provide comparisons to a catalogue with similar properties. In \S\ref{sec:efedsxmm} we construct a cluster sample from eFEDS with corresponding observations from {\em XMM} and match to sources detected in the {\em XMM} Cluster Survey. \S\ref{sec:meascomp} compares temperatures and luminosities measured by eFEDS and {\em XMM}. Finally, \S\ref{sec:prelimLT} and \S\ref{sec:conclusions} present luminosity-temperature relations based on eFEDS measurements and {\em XMM} observations of eFEDS clusters, then a final summary and thoughts on future work.

Throughout this work we use a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology where $\Omega_{\rm{M}}$=0.3, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$=0.7, and $\rm{H}_{0}$=70 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with the original eFEDS cluster analysis (and other XCS works).

\section{Comparison of the \lowercase{e}FEDS X-ray Cluster Candidate and XXL-100-GC catalogues}
\label{sec:efedsproperties}

%KR: should this paragraph be in the into?
The eFEDS field covers approximately 140 square degrees of the equatorial ($-2.5^{\circ}<\delta<6.0^{\circ}$) sky. It intersects with several optical/near-IR photometry and/or specroscopic surveys, including the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program \citep[HSC SSP, ][]{hscsurvey}, the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey \citep[GAMA, ][]{gamasurvey}, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \citep[SDSS, ][]{sdss}. The eFEDS cluster catalogue \citep{efedsclustercat} contains 542 candidates, 477 of which are optically confirmed \citep{efedsclusteropticalcat}. All 542 X-ray candidates are accompanied by $z$ values, and soft-band $L_{\rm X}$ values have been measured for 91\% of the X-ray sample. Average $T_{\rm X}$ values were obtained for 69 (300kpc) and 95 (500kpc) of the candidates, with the apertures centered on the eFEDS. Accounting for overlap, $T_{\rm X}$ values have been measured for 102 candidates, all of which are in the optically confirmed sample (i.e. 21\% of 477).

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/outline_withborder.png}
    \caption[]{Outline of the eFEDS footprint (black line). Cluster candidates present in the eFEDS X-ray catalogue are highlighted by red diamonds. The grey circles highlight {\em XMM} observations, with a radius of 15\arcmin (the approximate radius of the {\em XMM} FoV).}
    \label{fig:efedsxcsclusters}
\end{figure*}

Due to the contiguous and uniform nature of the eFEDS observations, it is natural to compare the overall sample properties to the XXL-100-GC sample \citep{xxlgc100}, which contains the 100 brightest galaxy clusters observed in the XXL \citep{xxlfoundation} fields. Combined, these fields cover ${\sim}50$ deg$^2$, and are made up of 542 separate {\em XMM} observations with on-axis exposure times ranging from 10-20ks. The flux limits of the eFEDS and XXL-100-GC cluster samples are also similar; ${\sim}10^{-14}\:\rm{erg}\:\rm{s}^{-1}\:\rm{cm}^{-2}$ for the whole eFEDS cluster candidate catalogue, $4.9\times10^{-14}\:\rm{erg}\:\rm{s}^{-1}\:\rm{cm}^{-2}$ for the eFEDS candidates with a measured temperature value in a 500kpc aperture, and $3\times10^{-14}\:\rm{erg}\:\rm{s}^{-1}\:\rm{cm}^{-2}$ for XXL-100-GC. These flux limits are calculated using slightly different methods, but even so their similarity justifies a comparison between these two samples.

Conveniently, XXL temperatures were also measured within a 300kpc aperture \citep{xxllt}, making a direct comparison of the overall distributions valid. Figure~\ref{fig:xxlefeds}a shows the redshift distributions of the clusters in the two samples (the eFEDS and XXL-100-GC distributions are shown in red and cyan respectively) to be very similar overall, but that XXL detects a higher proportion of clusters at low redshifts, and eFEDS has higher redshift candidates. Figure~\ref{fig:xxlefeds}b plots the temperature distributions of the two samples, with the XXL temperature distribution containing a significantly higher proportion of temperatures above ${\sim}4\:\rm{keV}$. This could be due to the selection functions of the two surveys, differing measurement methodology, or a systematic difference in temperatures measured by the {\em eROSITA} and {\em XMM} telescopes. Such a difference has been found between {\em XMM} and {\em Chandra}, and was recently calibrated by \cite{xmmchandracal}.

Finally we compare how well temperatures from the two samples are constrained, by comparing temperature uncertainties as a fraction of the absolute temperature value.  The temperature constraining power of XXL is shown to be greater than that of eFEDS in Figure~\ref{fig:xxlefeds}c, with the mean percentage uncertainties for XXL and eFEDS being 14\% and 25\% respectively. This fits with previous work by \cite{xcsmethod} that demonstrates ${\sim}2000$ background-subtracted soft-band (0.5-2.0keV) counts are required to achieve a fractional temperature uncertainty of ${\sim}0.1$. This would give the longer exposures of XXL an advantage over the eFEDS field (especially in the {\em XMM}-LSS fields which covers ${\sim}$11 deg$^{2}$ in the XXL-N field).

Since the XXL and eFEDS surveys were taken in different parts of the sky, there are no clusters in common, therefore, a direct comparison of individual clusters is not possible. As such, we used the {\em XMM} Cluster Survey \citep[XCS, ][]{xcsfoundation} cleaned data and source lists, to i) determine which eFEDS cluster candidates fall on an {\em XMM} observation; ii) verify that the candidates are clusters (also with {\em eROSITA} and SDSS images); iii) match the eFEDS candidates to an XCS extended source within these observations; and iv) measure properties for any eFEDS cluster that falls on an {\em XMM} observation.

\subsection{\lower{e}FEDS Cluster Candidates in the {\em XMM} Footprint}

Figure~\ref{fig:efedsxcsclusters} shows the outline of the eFEDS footprint with eFEDS X-ray cluster candidates indicated by red diamonds \cite[as taken from the catalogue of][]{efedsclustercat}. {\em XMM} observations overlapping the eFEDS footprint are given by grey shaded circles, with a radius of 15$^{\prime}$ (the approximate field-of-view of {\em XMM}). It highlights the extraordinary field of view of {\em eROSITA} and its utility as a survey instrument when compared to {\em XMM}. 
%as well as showing us that the majority of eFEDS cluster candidates do not fall on an {\em XMM} observation.

We used {\em XMM}: Generate and Analyse \citep[\texttt{XGA}\footnote{\href{https://github.com/DavidT3/XGA}{{\em XMM}: Generate and Analyse GitHub}}][]{xgapaper}; a new, open-source, X-ray astronomy analysis module developed by XCS, to determine which eFEDS cluster candidates fall within the footprint of an {\em XMM} observation. The 542 eFEDS clusters given in \cite{efedsclustercat} were used as a starting point, as we wished to compare for all possible candidates initially and then consider which candidates to keep in our analyses.

\texttt{XGA} initially performs a search through the XCS archive of cleaned event lists for observations with an aimpoint that falls within 30\arcmin of a candidate (at the eFEDS coordinates). \texttt{XGA} then (in this case) applies the requirement that 70\% of a 300kpc aperture centered on the eFEDS coordinate falls on an {\em XMM} camera. We found that 62 eFEDS X-ray cluster candidates have been observed by {\em XMM}, and this sample is henceforth called eFEDS-{\em XMM}.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/outskirt_cands.png}
    \caption[]{A spurious eFEDS-{\em XMM} cluster candidate found in the outskirts of a very bright point source. Left hand side is {\em XMM}, middle is SDSS, and right is {\em eROSITA}. Images are centered on the spiral galaxy responsible for the emission, white cross-hair indicates candidate eFEDS J085616.2-013945.}
    \label{fig:brightoutskirts}
\end{figure*}

% Near the centre of Figure~\ref{fig:efedsxcsclusters} we can see a significant collection of {\em XMM} observations, the Herschel-ATLAS contiguous field followups. The majority of the {\em XMM}-HATLAS observations are shallow, with requested exposures of ${\sim}$2.5ks. While this makes it relatively comparable to the depth of the eFEDS (and eRASS) fields, it unfortunately means that it is likely to be difficult to measure well constrained temperatures for many of the clusters in this field.

The distribution in Figure~\ref{fig:xmmexposure} demonstrates that the majority of eFEDS cluster candidates that fall on an XMM observation have a longer exposure time in {\em XMM} than the average 1.2ks vignetting-corrected exposure reported by \cite{efedsclustercat}. Though a direct exposure time comparison does not tell us everything about the relative usefulness of the {\em XMM} and {\em eROSITA} data (it is complicated by the relative effective area curves, as well as the different locations of the telescopes resulting in different levels of flaring and particle background), it does highlight that {\em XMM}-Newton observations (both new and archival) will continue to be important into the era of {\em eROSITA}, despite the impressive capabilities and field of view of the new telescope. 


\subsection{Verifying eFEDS-{\em XMM} Cluster Candidates}

%Now that we have a sample of eFEDS cluster candidates that have also been observed by {\em XMM}, we need to verify that they are galaxy clusters, that the {\em XMM} data are of a high enough quality for us to analyse, and whether they have been detected by XCS. We do not necessarily expect that the entire eFEDS-{\em XMM} sample will have high enough quality data for us to confirm or deny an eFEDS candidate, or measure X-ray properties for them. 

%XCS is a serendipitous survey utilising the entire archive of {\em XMM} observations to locate X-ray sources, with a focus on detecting galaxy clusters. Source detection is performed using a custom version of WAVDETECT \citep{wavdetect} called the XCS Automated Pipeline Algorithm \citep[XAPA,][]{xcsmethod}. XAPA is run on merged EPIC (PN+MOS1+MOS2) images, generated using events within an energy range of 0.5-2.0keV. This energy range is similar, but not identical, to the energy band in which eFEDS performed their source detection (0.2–2.3keV). Sources detected within separate {\em XMM} observations are then combined into an XCS Master Source List (XCS-MSL). As of mid 2020 this contains 327205 objects, of which 39890 (12\%) are classified as extended, and 332315 (88\%) are classified as point sources. 

Using the 62 clusters in the eFEDS-{\em XMM} sample, we generate {\em eROSITA}, {\em XMM}, and SDSS images in order to visually confirm the cluster candidates (in X-ray and optical), compare the observations of the {\em XMM} and {\em eROSITA} telescopes, and assess the quality of the {\em XMM} observations. The \texttt{eSASS} \texttt{evtool} software was used to generate images of {\em XMM} fields (centered on the same coordinates), while using the same binning and image size to ensure a scaling of 4.35\arcsec per pixel; this allowed a valid side-by-side comparison. Images were created in the energy bands used for source detection by the respective surveys, corresponding to 0.5-2.0~keV and 0.2-2.3~keV for XCS and eFEDS respectively.

Next, we perform source detection on the {\em XMM} images in order to aid in the visual inspection of the eFEDS clusters.  Source detection is performed using a custom version of WAVDETECT \citep{wavdetect} called the XCS Automated Pipeline Algorithm \citep[XAPA,][]{xcsmethod}. XAPA is run on merged EPIC (PN+MOS1+MOS2) images, generated using events within an energy range of 0.5-2.0keV. This energy range is similar, but not identical, to the energy band in which eFEDS performed their source detection (0.2–2.3keV). Sources detected within separate {\em XMM} observations are then combined into an XCS Master Source List (XCS-MSL). As of mid 2020 this contains 327205 objects, of which 39890 (12\%) are classified as extended, and 332315 (88\%) are classified as point sources.


\subsection{Examples of contamination in the eFEDS X-ray cluster candidate catalogue}

{\em XMM} is an ideal telescope with which to perform direct {\em eROSITA} image comparisons; the detector properties are very similar, but both the EPIC-PN and EPIC-MOS cameras have a slightly smaller PSF effect. This allows us to better identify cases where eFEDS cluster candidates are more consistent with point source (or blended point source) emission. A good example can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:pairagn}, where a pair of interacting galaxies with bright AGN (identified as such in the 0822470101 {\em XMM} proposal, and detected as a single point source in the {\em XMM} images), and another nearby point source have been understandably detected as a single extended source by the eROSITA source finder.

In Figure~\ref{fig:brightoutskirts} we see that eFEDS has spuriously identified a cluster candidate in the outskirts of a bright point source (a behaviour that is also seen in two other eFEDS-{\em XMM} candidates).  From SDSS (Fig~\ref{fig:brightoutskirts} middle) the X-ray emission is coming from a spiral galaxy with a bright core. 

An eFEDS-{\em XMM} candidate (eFEDS J085616.2-013945) is also present in the top left of the image, matching a small clump of red galaxies in the SDSS image. We do not visually confirm this cluster in {\em XMM}, but when smoothed we do see hints of extended emission in the {\em eROSITA} image. This could indicate that {\em eROSITA}'s X-ray background will allow it to detect low surface brightness clusters that have been missed by previous telescopes.  However, we exclude this cluster from our analyses due to contamination of the low redshift galaxy; this example illustrates that just because a cluster is confirmed, it doesn't necessarily mean that its X-ray emission should be analysed, as projection effects can be an issue for X-ray as well as optical observations. In this case, for instance, we would be fitting a model to the low redshift galaxy emission rather than the cluster, which could bias any scaling relations constructed with a sample containing this source.

    \label{fig:splitcluster}
\end{figure}

During our visual inspection of the eFEDS-{\em XMM} candidates, we found one instance where the detection of a good cluster candidate in the {\em eROSITA} image has been split into two separate entries in the X-ray cluster catalogue. Figure~\ref{fig:splitcluster} shows {\em XMM} and {\em eROSITA} images of the cluster, with the white cross-hair indicating the position of the first cluster fragment (eFEDS J085022.3+001607), and the white diamond the other fragment (eFEDS J085027.9+001503). The two eFEDS-XMM candidates have almost identical eFEDS redshifts (0.196 and 0.197 respectively), both have successful eFEDS luminosity measurements, but only eFEDS J085027.9+001503 has a successful (but poorly constrained) temperature measurement. Unfortunately we are forced to exclude both candidates, even though the second is one of the few candidates that has an eFEDS temperature measurement and high quality {\em XMM} data; this is because we expect that part of the cluster will have been excluded in the eFEDS analysis, and as such the temperature and luminosity are invalid. 

\begin{figure*}

    \caption[]{An eFEDS-{\em XMM} cluster candidate (eFEDS J084201.8+005942) without an obvious corresponding source of emission. The cross-hair indicates the eFEDS position, with a 3\arcmin aperture. Left image is {\em XMM}, middle is SDSS, right is {\em eROSITA}.}
    \label{fig:blanksky}
\end{figure*}

We also observed cases where no X-ray source is present in {\em XMM} or {\em eROSITA} images. Figure~\ref{fig:blanksky} is an example where we cannot locate a source at the eFEDS coordinates (extended or otherwise) in the image taken by either X-ray telescope (with the {\em XMM} observation being deeper than eFEDS), and as such it is hard to know what the eFEDS source finder detected here. The redshift provided by the eFEDS cluster catalogue for this candidate (eFEDS J084201.8+005942) is very low (0.087).  Inspection using SDSS does not indicate any overdensity of galaxies at the eFEDS coordinates.  Therefore, the eFEDS detection remains somewhat of a mystery.  

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/elliptical_xray.png}
    \caption[]{An eFEDS-{\em XMM} cluster candidate (eFEDS J092002.2+010220) that appears to be a low-redshift, bright, X-ray emitting elliptical galaxy.

    \label{fig:ellipticalxray}
\end{figure*}

Finally, we encountered two cases where X-ray emission attributed to a galaxy cluster was significantly contaminated by an X-ray bright elliptical galaxy. We consider these sources (eFEDS J092002.2+010220 and eFEDS J092235.9-002443) to be low redshift groups.  Figure~\ref{fig:ellipticalxray} shows the {\em XMM} and {\em eROSITA} images related to the first of these candidates, with the addition of an SDSS image for further context. The extended X-ray emission appears to dominated by the galaxy, rather than any significant emission from an intra-group medium.

Preparatory work by \cite{simerass} predicted that the contamination of the X-ray cluster candidate catalogue would be ${\sim}$20\%, and an eFEDS analysis by \cite{efedsclusteropticalcat} found a value in agreement with that prediction. We consider 15 candidates (for this we take one of the split cluster candidate to be a genuine detection, even though we do not include this in our analysis) that we do not drop for reasons of {\em XMM} data quality or contaminated cluster emission, and find the contamination of the eFEDS-{\em XMM} sample to be ${\sim}$24\%, which is higher than, but still broadly compatible with, the simulation prediction and the measured eFEDS value.

\subsection{Constructing the \lower{e}FEDS-XCS cluster sample}

Based upon visual inspection, we drop 26 of the 62 candidates in the eFEDS-{\em XMM} sample (as discussed below) and will not use them in the analyses presented in this work.  Of the candidates that were not included in the final sample, 7 were dropped due to the extremely low quality {\em XMM} data available (see Table~\ref{tab:xmmrejects} for further information), hence any confirmation of the eFEDS clusters is not possible with {\em XMM}.  A further 3  were discarded due to contamination of the intra-cluster/group medium by another significant X-ray source (see Table~\ref{tab:contamrejects} for further information).

Of the remaining 16 candidates not included in our final sample, 4 do not appear to be coincident with an X-ray source in {\em XMM} and {\em eROSITA} images, 3 appear to be point sources in {\em XMM} and SDSS, 2 exhibit some extended X-ray emission but are point sources in SDSS, 3 are spurious detections in the outskirts of very bright sources, 1 exhibits some extended emission in X-ray but we see no cluster galaxies in SDSS, 1 exhibit some extended emission in X-ray but seems to be a galaxy in SDSS, and 2 candidates (we have to discard both parts from our analysis) are a cluster that the eFEDS source finder has split into two parts. See Table~\ref{tab:rejects} for information on these candidates, including name, location, and reason for being dropped. Of the 16 eFEDS-{\em XMM} candidates dropped for contamination reasons, 12 have luminosity entries in the eFEDS X-ray cluster catalogue and 1 (a galaxy cluster fragment) has a temperature entry.

The vast majority of eFEDS-XCS clusters appear in one or two {\em XMM} observations, several appear in three, and one cluster appears in five. Of these clusters, we find that 19 have at least one on-axis observation (defined here as being within 5 arcminutes of the aimpoint), indicating that they could have been targeted observations. As we do not make comparisons between targeted and serendipitous {\em XMM} cluster detections in this work we do not attempt to make more more specific classifications. We have detected 27 of the candidates in the eFEDS-XCS sample, where \texttt{XGA} defines a detection as the input coordinates falling within an extended source region as created by XAPA.

The cleaned sample is henceforth called eFEDS-XCS. 

\subsection{Comparing to the eFEDS optically confirmed cluster sample}

We use the 477 cluster candidates that \cite{efedsclusteropticalcat} defined as optically confirmed to assess whether any of the 16 eFEDS-{\em XMM} candidates in Table~\ref{tab:rejects} were included in the eFEDS optically confirmed sample. We find that 9 of the 16 eFEDS-{\em XMM} candidates are present in the optically confirmed catalogue (these are marked by a dagger in Table~\ref{tab:rejects}).  This includes both eFEDS J085027.9+001503 and eFEDS J085022.3+001607, the two pieces of the fragmented cluster detection shown in Figure~\ref{fig:splitcluster}. If this behaviour of fragmenting a cluster into multiple sources exists elsewhere in the eFEDS X-ray cluster candidate catalogue, then we would expect to see a similar behaviour where multiple fragments are accepted into the optically confirmed sample as separate clusters. This is a consequence of directing a cluster confirmation tool such as the Multi-component Matched Filter Cluster Confirmation Tool \citep[MCMF,][]{MCMF} to a particular, X-ray defined, position, as the fragments are so close together (and both fragment positions fall within the cluster) that it will be probing essentially the same galaxy population. The alternative approach, however, is to match between cluster candidates from X-ray source detection and optical cluster catalogues from cluster finders such as the red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation \citep[redMaPPer,][]{redMaPPer} algorithm, the Cluster finding algorithm based on Multi-band Identification of Red-sequence gAlaxies \citep[CAMIRA,][]{camira}, or the Wavelet Z Photometric \citep[WaZP,][]{WaZP} cluster finder, which has its own difficulties. The advantage of matching between catalogues in this particular instance would be the simple diagnostic test of checking whether one optical cluster candidate has multiple X-ray matches, though a similar test should be possible with the cluster confirmation method. 

If we discount the fragmented cluster, we find that the optically confirmed eFEDS cluster sample has a minimal level of contamination, at a level of ${\sim}$3\%. We also find that one of the candidates (eFEDS J090553.6+002244) that we accept into the eFEDS-XCS sample does not appear in the optically confirmed sample, though all other eFEDS-XCS candidates do. 

\subsection{Positions of cluster central coordinates}
We observed some cases where the eFEDS coordinate deviates significantly from that of a matching XAPA extended source. This generally seems to be due low signal-to-noise {\em eROSITA} data for that cluster candidate, though in some cases point source contamination appears to shift the central coordinate toward the point source. This could cause issues when combining eRASS and optical cluster catalogues, as X-ray observations are often used to calibrate the mis-centering of optical cluster finders \citep[][]{desmiscentering}, which often select the BCG as the central coordinate. Creating mis-centering priors from eRASS catalogues may be difficult if there is a large proportion of poorly constrained central coordinates.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{images/eFEDS_XAPA_offset.png}
    \caption[]{Comparison of eFEDS central coordinates to XAPA central coordinates, for the subset of the eFEDS-XCS sample that have been detected by XAPA.}
    \label{fig:centcoords}
\end{figure}

We compare the eFEDs positions of eFEDS-XCS clusters to XAPA detection central coordinates for those clusters that have been detected by XCS.  Figure~\ref{fig:centcoords} plots the distributions of offsets between the eFEDS and XAPA coordinates (in units of kpc, calculated at the eFEDS redshift).  This indicates that there can be significant differences in the centroid positions of the two surveys, though the majority of the clusters have an offset smaller than 100kpc. We chose XAPA central coordinates rather than \texttt{XGA} peak positions to provide the fairest comparison for eFEDS positions, as centroid and peak finder techniques for measuring a central cluster position differ significantly.  We also expect centroid techniques to perform better on shallower data, though X-ray peaks are preferred for calibrations of mis-centering.

    \label{fig:efedsxmmtxdist}
\end{figure*}

We use \texttt{XGA}'s XSPEC \citep[][]{xspec} interface to measure spectroscopic properties of those clusters that have high enough quality data, and compare those values to those presented in the eFEDS data release. Note that we do not re-analyse the eFEDS data and compare purely to the measurements given by \cite{efedsclustercat}. We use \texttt{XGA} v0.2, SAS v17.0.0, and XSPEC v12.10.1.

\subsection{Fitting Procedure}
\label{subsec:fitproc}

Cluster spectra are extracted within a 500kpc fixed aperture (used since the eFEDS catalog contains a greater number of 500 kpc temperatures than 300 kpc) and centered on the eFEDS position.  Corresponding backgrounds are extracted within 1000-1500~kpc annuli.  Interloper sources in both the 500kpc apertures and background regions are identified using the XCS region files, and their corresponding events are removed during spectrum generation.  We fit absorbed \cite[with tbabs, ][]{tbabs} plasma emission models \citep[APEC, ][]{apec} to the spectra; these models are standard for XCS analyses, but are also the same as those used in the eFEDS spectroscopic analysis. To maximise the similarity of our analysis to eFEDS we opt to use the abundance tables published by \cite{aspl} when performing our spectral fits. The abundance parameter of the APEC model in all cases is set to 0.3Z$_{\odot}$ and frozen, the nH parameter of the tbabs model is set from the full-sky HI survey by the \cite{nh} (using the HEASoft \texttt{nh} tool) and frozen. The redshift parameter is set to the eFEDS catalogue value and frozen.

All available observations and cameras are allowed to contribute to the fit of a given galaxy cluster, provided that they meet certain conditions. First, we require every spectrum to have a minimum of 10 noticed channels, ensuring no spectra have been re-binned to have only one or two channels. Each of these spectra are first fit independently, with the temperature and normalisation parameters allowed to vary.  If the measured temperature is $\leq$0.01keV, $>$20keV, or the temperature uncertainty is $>$ 15keV, then the corresponding spectrum will be rejected and not included in the final fit. When a set of acceptable spectra has been compiled, a final simultaneous fit is performed using only those spectra. An absorbed plasma emission model is created for each spectrum, then the temperature and normalisation parameters of all models are linked.  For this fit we add a simple multiplicative constant, to account for the differences in normalisation from different observations and still allow us to retrieve a single normalisation value at the end (as it has a physical meaning). The constant of the first model is set to 1 and frozen, and in all other models is allowed to vary freely.  Temperature values (after XSPEC has run a suitable error calculation step), as well as the un-absorbed luminosity in energy bands of our choice, are then determined from this final fit.

\texttt{XGA} considers a temperature measurement successful if, a) the measured temperature is less than 25~keV, b) the upper and lower uncertainties are both positive, and c) the larger uncertainty is less than three times the smaller. Luminosity measurements are considered successful if the uncertainty is not greater than the luminosity, and if the upper and lower uncertainties are both positive. If a cluster's temperature or luminosity measurement do not meet these requirements, then we do not use that cluster for any of the following analyses.

For a more complete explanation of \texttt{XGA} spectral fits, and comparisons of results with other {\em XMM} analyses that confirm the veracity of measurements produced by the \texttt{XGA} procedure, see \cite{xcsmassmethod}. All values measured by \texttt{XGA} for the eFEDS-XCS sample can be found in Table~\ref{tab:measurements}, along with eFEDS name, position, and redshift.

\subsection{Preliminary Temperature Calibration}
\label{subsec:tcal}
There is a known difference between the galaxy cluster temperatures measured by {\em XMM} and {\em Chandra} so, in order to test for a similar difference, our first comparison is made between temperatures presented in the eFEDs cluster catalogue and {\em XMM} temperatures that we have measured for the same clusters. An understanding of whether there is a systematic difference in {\em eROSITA} and {\em XMM} temperatures will be necessary before any joint analyses with data from the two telescopes is undertaken, and before scaling relations from one telescope can be safely used by another.

A comparison of the 8 clusters with measured {\em XMM} and eFEDS temperatures is given in Figure~\ref{fig:xmmexposure}.  Qualitatively, this appears to show an offset between the two telescopes.  All but one of the points lies below the one-to-one line, indicating that the {\em XMM} temperatures are systematically higher than the {\em eROSITA} temperatures. The majority of clusters are consistent with the one-to-one line but there does appear to be a systematic offset. To model this, we fit a power law of the form

\begin{align}
{\rm log}\left(T^{\:\rm{eROSITA}}_{\rm{x, 500kpc}}\right) &= {\rm log}(A_{TT}) + B_{TT}{\rm log}\left(T^{\:\rm{XMM}}_{\rm{x, 500kpc}}\right) \pm \sigma_{T_{\rm{eROSITA}}|T_{\rm{XMM}}},
\label{equ:TvsT}
\end{align}
where $A_{TT}$ is the normalisation, $B_{TT}$ the slope and $\sigma_{T_{\rm{eROSITA}}|T_{\rm{XMM}}}$ the intrinsic scatter. The fits were performed in log space using the R package LInear Regression in Astronomy\citep[{\sc lira}\footnote{\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lira/index.html}{LInear Regression in Astronomy}}, ][]{softlira}, fully described in \cite{LIRA}. The best fit parameters are given in Table~\ref{tab:tempcal}. 

First, we fit the power law with the slope left free to vary, probing whether the observed offset evolves with temperature \citep[as found in][comparing between {\em Chandra} and {\em XMM}]{xmmchandracal}. We measure a slope value of 0.87$^{+0.37}_{-0.27}$, indicating that the calibration evolves with system temperature.  We note however that due to the large errors, the value of $B_{TT}$ is consistent with 1 (within 1$\sigma$).  The measured intrinsic scatter of both fits is very low (essentially consistent with zero), which is as expected.
 
Due to the large errors on the measure slope, we re-fit the power-law with the slope fixed at unity.  This allows us to measure a single overall factor that describes the average difference in temperatures measured by the two telescopes.  We measure a normalisation of 0.75$^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$, meaning that (on average) {\em eROSITA} measures a temperature ${\sim}25\%$ cooler than those measured by {\em XMM} for the same cluster.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\caption[]{{\small The normalisation, slope, and intrinsic scatter values of the fitted temperature calibration models for 500kpc apertures. $A_{TT}$ is normalisation, $B_{TT}$ is slope, and $\sigma_{T_{\rm{eROSITA}}|T_{\rm{XMM}}}$ the intrinsic scatter.}\label{tab:tempcal}}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\hline
\hline
Calibration Name & $A_{TT}$ & $B_{TT}$ & $\sigma_{T_{\rm{eROSITA}}|T_{\rm{XMM}}}$\\
\hline

\end{table}

As we have not re-analysed {\em eROSITA} spectra and measured our own temperatures for the eFEDS-XCS cluster sample, our methodologies are unlikely to be completely consistent, and as such the observed temperature calibration could be the result of some mismatch in our measuring procedures. This is compounded by the small number of clusters that have both an eFEDS and an {\em XMM} temperature, and the relatively large uncertainties on the eFEDS temperatures. However, we have provided evidence of an offset that requires further investigation, ideally with a larger sample of clusters with better constrained eFEDS temperatures.

\subsection{Temperature Distributions Comparison}
We have been able to measure temperatures for many of the eFEDS-XCS sample that do not have an eFEDS temperature measurement, so while like-for-like comparisons are limited to the clusters in Figure~\ref{fig:t500kpccomp}, we can still compare overall temperature distributions.

In Figure~\ref{fig:efedsxmmtxdist}a, which shows the overall temperature distributions of the eFEDS and eFEDS-XCS samples, we see an enhancement of the {\em XMM} temperature distribution over the eFEDs distribution above ${\sim}$4keV, similar to what we saw in Figure~\ref{fig:xxlefeds}b with the XXL-100-GC sample. It is possible that this enhanced population of high temperature clusters are due to selection effects resulting from targeted {\em XMM} exposures. Combined with the fact that we also observe this effect when eFEDS data is compared to XXL-100-GC, however, means that is another possible indication of a temperature calibration being required between the two telescopes.

Figure~\ref{fig:efedsxmmtxdist}b demonstrates that a larger proportion of the eFEDS-XCS sample (compared to eFEDS measurements) have a fractional temperature uncertainty of less than 20\%, and as such the {\em XMM} temperature measurements are generally better constrained. However we also note that the temperature fractional error distribution of the eFEDS-XCS sample extends to larger values than eFEDS. Although {\em XMM} has observed only a fraction of the total area of the sky, any cluster that does fall on a pointing (whether targeted or serendipitous) and can have an {\em XMM} temperature measured for it, is likely to have comparable constraints to an eFEDS temperature. However, especially for serendipitous clusters near the edge of the field of view, there will be instances were no temperature at all can be measured.

Archival {\em XMM} observations can still provide temperatures which are, on average, better constrained than eFEDS for those clusters that have been observed by {\em XMM}, and as such {\em XMM} archival and targeted observations will have an important part to play in the future of X-ray studies of galaxy clusters.

Grey line indicates a power-law fit with slope set to 1 (with 68\% confidence levels given by grey shaded region).}
    \label{fig:l500kpccomp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Luminosity Comparison}
We also compare the luminosities measured by both {\em XMM} and {\em eROSITA}, since one of the main products of {\em eROSITA} will be massive catalogues of X-ray luminosities. These will be used as the basis of various {\em eROSITA} science applications, for example, a mass-luminosity scaling relation provides a way to estimate overdensity radii of a given cluster, as well as providing a path to large scale cluster cosmology with X-ray clusters.  Therefore, it is again important to test the fidelity of eFEDS luminosities with {\em XMM} data.  As the eFEDS analysis employs an image-based method of measuring luminosities, we can compare our results to many more clusters than in the temperature calibration.

The eFEDS analysis presents cluster luminosities measured via a forward-fitting analysis of 2D count-rate maps, including considerations of the morphology of the cluster, rather than by the fitting of emission models to spectroscopic data. In the context of the eFEDS (and in the future eRASS), they are able to measure accurate luminosities for clusters that do not have high enough quality data to perform spectral fitting. We opt to use a spectral fitting process to measure unabsorbed (corrected for hydrogen column absorption) luminosities in the soft (0.5-2.0keV) and bolometric (0.01-100keV) energy bands.

We fit the same two models as used for the temperature calibration (a power-law with the slope fixed at 1, and left to vary), to the luminosity comparison, finding the results of both to be entirely consistent with a one-to-one relation. Figure~\ref{fig:l500kpccomp} demonstrates the excellent soft-band luminosity agreement (including the two models) between eFEDS and XCS, which is extremely encouraging given the different methods. The bolometric comparison (not given for the sake of clarity) shows a similar agreement.

\section{Preliminary L$_{\rm{x}}$-T$_{\rm{x}}$ relations}
\label{sec:prelimLT}

Here we construct luminosity-temperature scaling relations from both the eFEDS and XCS measured values. Such relations are frequently used to probe the self-similarity of a population of clusters, but in this case we wish to use them as a diagnostic tool to probe differences in measurements made by eFEDS and XCS.

    \label{fig:efedsandxcslt}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fitting Scaling Relations}

We choose not to restrict ourselves only to clusters that have successful measurements from both surveys, due to the very limited size of the sub-sample that would produce. Instead we use all eFEDS-XCS clusters (with a successful T$_{x}$ and L$_{x}$ measurement), and all available eFEDS candidates and compare the relations. We present a scaling relations with properties measured in a 500kpc aperture, with luminosities in a 0.5-2.0keV energy band. We fit a power law of the form, 

\begin{align}
{\rm log}\left(\frac{L^{500\rm{kpc}}_{\rm{x, 0.5-2.0}}}{E(z)L_{0}}\right) &= {\rm log}(A_{LT}) + B_{LT}{\rm log}\left(\frac{T^{\rm{500kpc}}_{\rm{x}}}{T_{0}}\right) \pm \sigma_{L|T},
\label{equ:lt}
\end{align}
where $A_{LT}$ denotes the normalisation, $B_{LT}$ the slope, and $\sigma_{L|T}$ the intrinsic scatter of the relation. We calculate E(z)$^{-1}$ using the redshift supplied in the eFEDS catalogue and our chosen concordance cosmology.  The fits are again performed using the LIRA package. We set the normalisation values for soft-band luminosity and temperature to approximate median eFEDS values of $L_{0}$=0.2$\times$10$^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ and $T_{0}$=2.3~keV.

The eFEDS and eFEDS-XCS L$^{500\rm{kpc}}_{\rm{x, 0.5-2.0}}$ - T$_{\rm{x}}^{500\rm{kpc}}$ scaling relations are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:efedsandxcslt}, using data from 94 (eFEDS) and 29 (eFEDS-XCS) galaxy clusters and cover broadly similar temperature range of 0.5-6.7~keV for eFEDS and 0.7-7.8~keV for eFEDS-XCS. The temperature overlap ensures that the eFEDS-XCS sample does not preferentially select a particular population of high or low temperature clusters, and as such it is valid to compare eFEDS-XCS and eFEDS luminosity-temperature relations directly.

% \subsection{Measuring a calibrated eFEDS-XCS relation}

% Finally, we measure a third version of the scaling relation, designed to test the effect of the temperature calibration we quantify in section \ref{subsec:tcal} on the full eFEDS-XCS sample. If a calibration is required between temperatures measured by {\em eROSITA} and {\em XMM}, then we would expect to see differences in the normalisation and slope of luminosity-temperature relations created from the two instruments. The two cases we consider in our efforts to quantify the observed temperature discrepancy (a constant factor, or relation that evolves with T$_{x}$ would produce different effects in a luminosity-temperature relation. A constant factor temperature offset would only have a significant effect on the normalisation of the relation, whereas an evolving offset would also have an impact on the slope. Figure \ref{fig:efedsandxcslt} makes it quite clear that there are significant differences in the slopes of the two relations, which better fits the second case, an evolving temperature calibration. As such, we measure the calibrated luminosity-temperature relation by using the power law model (with slope free to vary), with parameter values provided in Table~\ref{tab:tempcal}, to simply convert the valid eFEDS-XCS temperature values to their equivalent eROSITA values. 

% Unfortunately, as they are built upon a population, scaling relations are sensitive to selection effects and as such our comparison of eFEDs, eFEDS-XCS, and calibrated eFEDS-XCS scaling relations may be affected (unlike our direct temperature comparison). However, if we measure the relation with a calibration applied to {\em XMM} temperatures and it brings the eFEDS and eFEDS-XCS relations into better agreement with one another, it could still be another hint that such a calibration is required. 

\subsection{Comparison of relations}
Finally, we measure a third version of the scaling relation, designed to test the effect of the temperature calibration we quantify in Section \ref{subsec:tcal} on the full eFEDS-XCS sample. As such, we measure the calibrated luminosity-temperature relation by using the power law model (with slope free to vary), with parameter values provided in Table~\ref{tab:tempcal}, to simply convert the valid eFEDS-XCS temperature values to their equivalent eROSITA values. 

Figure~\ref{fig:efedsandxcslt} shows the first two relations, using the eFEDS catalogue measurements and eFEDS-XCS measurements. We can clearly see that the eFEDS relation has a steeper slope than that produced by the eFEDS-XCS sample, and the parameter values presented in Table~\ref{tab:relations} show that the eFEDS-XCS normalisation and slope are not consistent with the eFEDS values, the slope is shallower and the normalisation lower. The intrinsic scatter of the two data-sets is more consistent, which makes sense as it shouldn't be affected by a systematic offset in either the luminosity or temperature values.

Figure~\ref{fig:prelimlt} shows the model fits for all three relations (with data points omitted for clarity), and shows that the eFEDS-XCS calibrated scaling relation has a steepened slope and increased normalisation when compared to the original eFEDS-XCS relation. This brings it more in line with the relation which we measured using the eFEDs catalogue; the normalisation parameter of the calibrated eFEDS-XCS relation in Table~\ref{tab:relations} is consistent with the eFEDS relation, but while the slope of the calibrated relation is steeper, it is still not consistent with eFEDS. Figure~\ref{fig:ltcorner} shows a shift of the contours and distributions towards eFEDS, but the results are still in tension. Only a very small change in the scatter parameter is measured, which again makes sense as the calibration procedure should not have a significant effect on the intrinsic scatter of the relation.

Our eFEDS-XCS calibrated relation does not lie on top of the eFEDS relation, but shifts in the right direction; the remaining difference could be related to the small number of clusters used to measure the calibration function or selection effects, but this comparison could be another indication of a temperature disparity between {\em XMM} and {\em eROSITA}.

The luminosity temperature relations presented in Table~\ref{tab:relations} were measured for these comparisons rather than a scientific use-case, as using a fixed aperture for luminosity measurements in that context would not be valid; as such we choose not to compare to existing scaling relations in literature.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
Here we summarise this work, and the conclusions we have reached, as well as giving some insight into further research that will be needed in the future.

\subsection{Summary}
In this work we have performed the first comparison between cluster properties measured by the eFEDS survey and those measured by {\em XMM} surveys, such as XCS and XXL, both directly and for whole cluster populations. We have located and analysed eFEDS cluster candidates which have a counterpart in an {\em XMM} observation, and presented comparison's between cluster temperatures and luminosities. As part of this process we also visually inspected the eFEDS cluster candidates that lie on an {\em XMM} observation and rejected any that had no ICM emission at the eFEDS coordinates, had obviously contaminated ICM emission, or too low quality {\em XMM} data.

A discrepancy between cluster temperatures measured by eFEDS and XCS has been found and quantified, which could hint at the need for a calibration function between the eROSITA and {\em XMM} telescopes (as has been necessary between {\em XMM} and {\em Chandra}). Several variables need to be better controlled before we can definitively state that the observed discrepancy is entirely due to a required temperature calibration, but combined with the enhanced fraction of higher temperature clusters in the XXL-100-GC and eFEDS-XCS catalogues when compared to eFEDS values, we consider it to be a likely explanation. 
 
Our analysis finds excellent agreement between soft-band luminosities measured by eFEDS and \texttt{XGA} for the eFEDS-XCS sample, which is very encouraging for future eRASS cosmology analyses. Such analyses will rely almost exclusively on mass-luminosity relations \citep[such as the eFEDS-HSC collaboration, ][]{efedsmor}, as even full depth eRASS will not be able to measure temperatures for enough galaxy clusters. 

We also fit and compare the first luminosity-temperature scaling relations using data from eFEDS and eFEDS-XCS {\em XMM} counterparts, using them to compare scaling relations measured with {\em eROSITA} and {\em XMM} data. This has particular relevance for anyone wishing to use an {\em XMM} generated scaling relation in an {\em eROSITA} analysis, or vice versa, as we find a distinct tension between scaling relations from the eFEDS and eFEDS-XCS samples. We also generate a second, calibrated, eFEDS-XCS scaling relation which is in slightly better agreement with the eFEDS relation, which again may suggest that a temperature scaling between {\em XMM} and {\em eROSITA} is necessary. It is likely, however, that a large part of the observed tension between the scaling relations is due to selection effects.

Our visual inspections of the eFEDS cluster candidates that fall on an {\em XMM} field (using {\em eROSITA}, {\em XMM}, and SDSS images) have shown that there are some aspects of {\em eROSITA}'s source finding and confirmation steps that can introduce spurious sources into their catalogues, which in turn could impact their cosmological analyses. Our inspection process finds that the eFEDS-XMM sample is ${\sim}$24\% contaminated (broadly in line with eFEDS predictions and measured values), and that only a minimal (${\sim}$3\%) level of contamination remains in the optically confirmed sample.

Our comparisons have shown that we can expect a great deal of useful data from the full eRASS catalogues, and that {\em XMM}-Newton still has a significant part to play as followup instrument. Its archive of 20 years worth of observations is still extremely valuable to the {\em eROSITA} team, and the X-ray astronomy community as a whole, and there will be many excellent opportunities for synergies between the two telescopes.

\subsection{Future Work}

Further exploration into the possible temperature calibration is required, including a complete re-analysis of the eFEDS cluster candidates' raw data using an identical methodology to the {\em XMM} analysis; this will eliminate a possible cause of the temperature discrepancy. To better constrain the relationship between {\em XMM} and {\em eROSITA} temperatures we should also aim to acquire follow-up {\em XMM} observations of a representative sample of eFEDS cluster candidates, preferentially targeting optically confirmed systems with the best temperature constraints of the sample. Both increasing the size of the sample that we can directly compare to, and comparing to clusters that have better constrained temperatures, will reduce the uncertainties on our temperature calibration model.

A full examination of {\em eROSITA} and SDSS images generated around the positions of every eFEDS cluster candidate is required to understand how often X-ray source detection issues arise in a full eRASS depth field, as the eFEDS-{\em XMM} sub-sample may not be representative of the number of issues found in the full field. Given the scale of eRASS, and the number of clusters it expects to find, it is unfeasible to have a human visually examine every candidate. As such it is crucial that the eFEDS field is used to understand whether some of the contamination of the X-ray sample can be offset by extra diagnostic steps or techniques.

An analysis working in the other direction, taking XCS cluster candidates and searching for their counterparts in the eFEDS field, to understand the detection limits of eFEDS and if/why it misses clusters detected in {\em XMM} observations by XCS.

\section{eFEDS-XCS Measurements}
\label{app:measurements}
In Table \ref{tab:xmmobs} we present information on the {\em XMM} data that were used for each eFEDS-XCS cluster, including the unique {\em XMM} observation identifier and as which instruments had usable data. We also include information on which instruments of which observations were allowed to contribute to the final luminosity and temperature measurements (for the two measurements apertures) of each eFEDS-XCS cluster. 
In Table \ref{tab:measurements} we present temperature and luminosity values measured for the clusters in the eFEDS-XCS sample. We use XGA to generate spectra and run XSPEC fits for these clusters. The fitting procedure is discussed in more detail in Section \ref{subsec:fitproc}. All measurements are centered on the eFEDS coordinates from the X-ray cluster candidate catalogue, with redshift information also taken from that catalogue.
