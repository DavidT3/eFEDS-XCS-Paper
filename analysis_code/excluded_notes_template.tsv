8094	True	False	On the edge of the XMM field of view.
7700	True	False	On the edge of the XMM field of view.
1797	True	False	On the edge of the XMM field of view (the eROSITA image confirms presence of an extended source).
11836	True	False	On the edge of the XMM field of view, and the XMM observation is shallow (xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates). The eROSITA image confirms presence of an extended source.
9877	True	False	Low signal-to-noise XMM image (xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates) which has been affected by flaring. 
2757	True	False	Low signal-to-noise XMM image (xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates).
5858	True	False	Low signal-to-noise XMM image (xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates). eROSITA image confirms presence of extended source.
2074	True	False	Low signal-to-noise XMM image (xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates).
11837	True	False	Low signal-to-noise XMM image (xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates) which has been affected by flaring. The eROSITA image confirms presence of an extended source.
1644	False	False	X-ray emission appears coincident with two interacting active galaxies (identified from XMM proposal).
3334	False	False	No significant X-ray emission in XMM or eROSITA, especially considering low redshift assigned in the eFEDS catalogue.
8602	False	False	This candidate is a cluster that has been split in two, the other part has the eFEDS source ID 1023.
1376	True	False	XMM data too shallow for confirmation. The eROSITA and SDSS data indicate a likely cluster, but eFEDS coordinate is offset from the extended emission and SDSS galaxies. 
5909	False	False	eFEDS candidate detected as a point source in XCS. There are no galaxies coincident with the X-ray emission in SDSS.
8922	False	False	Spurious detection in the outskirts of an X-ray bright spiral galaxy.
16370	False	True	eFEDS candidate coincident with a collection of galaxies in SDSS/HSC; however X-ray emission is contaminated by low redshift spiral galaxy.
9463	False	False	eFEDS candidate detected as two separate point sources in XCS with deeper XMM (xxx s at eFEDS coordinates) data.
13484	False	False	No obvious extended X-ray emission in eROSITA or XMM.  There is no evidence of cluster galaxies in SDSS at the eFEDS measured redshift (z=0.317).
13299	False	False	Spurious detection in the outskirts of the X-ray emission of a bright star.
150	False	True	SDSS/HSC indicates the presence of a group of galaxies, however, the X-ray emission originates primarily from the central galaxy.
11754	False	False	Spurious detection in the outskirts of eFEDS 150.
3133	False	True	SDSS/HSC indicates the presence of a group of galaxies, however, the X-ray emission originates primarily from the central galaxy.
3008	False	True	SDSS/HSC indicates the presence of a group of galaxies, however, the X-ray emission originates primarily from the central galaxy.
5702	False	False	Deeper XMM observation (xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates) reveals the X-ray emission is coming from a blue object in SDSS (which appears to be an AGN), XCS detects this as a point source 
6840	False	False	eFEDS candidate appears to be coincident with a blue source in SDSS (potentially an AGN). XCS detects XMM emission as a point source, again, coincident with the SDSS source.
