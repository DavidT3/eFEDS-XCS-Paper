8094	True	On the edge of the {\em XMM} field of view.
7700	True	On the edge of the {\em XMM} field of view.
1797	True	On the edge of the {\em XMM} field of view (the {\em eROSITA} image confirms presence of an extended source).
11836	True	On the edge of the {\em XMM} field of view, and the {\em XMM} observation is shallow ({\color{red} xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates}). The {\em eROSITA} image confirms presence of an extended source.
9877	True	Low signal-to-noise {\em XMM} image ({\color{red} xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates}) which has been affected by flaring. 
2757	True	Low signal-to-noise {\em XMM} image ({\color{red} xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates}).
5858	True	Low signal-to-noise {\em XMM} image ({\color{red} xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates}).The {\em eROSITA} image confirms presence of an extended source.
2074	True	Low signal-to-noise {\em XMM} image ({\color{red} xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates}).
11837	True	Low signal-to-noise {\em XMM} image ({\color{red} xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates}) which has been affected by flaring. The {\em eROSITA} image confirms presence of an extended source.
1644	False	X-ray emission appears coincident with two interacting active galaxies (identified from {\em XMM} proposal).
3334	False	No significant X-ray emission in {\em XMM} or {\em eROSITA}, especially considering the low redshift assigned in the eFEDS catalogue.
8602	False	This candidate is a cluster that has been split in two, the other part has the eFEDS source ID 1023.
1376	False	XMM data too shallow for confirmation. The {\em eROSITA} and SDSS data indicate a likely cluster, but eFEDS coordinate is offset from the extended emission. 
5909	False	eFEDS candidate detected as a point source in XCS. There are no galaxies coincident with the X-ray emission in SDSS.
8922	False	Spurious detection in the outskirts of an X-ray bright spiral galaxy.
16370	False	eFEDS candidate coincident with a collection of galaxies in SDSS; however X-ray emission is contaminated by low redshift spiral galaxy.
9463	False	eFEDS candidate detected as two separate point sources in XCS using deeper {\em XMM} ({\color{red} xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates}) data.
13484	False	No obvious extended X-ray emission in {\em eROSITA} or {\em XMM}.  There is no evidence of cluster galaxies in SDSS at the eFEDS measured redshift (z=0.317).
13299	False	Spurious detection in the outskirts of the X-ray emission of a bright star.
150	False	X-ray extended emission dominated by a massive elliptical galaxy.
11754	False	Spurious detection in the outskirts of eFEDS 150.
3133	False	SDSS indicates the presence of a group of galaxies, however, the eFEDS emission is likely dominated by the central massive elliptical galaxy.
3008	False	CONTRADICTION HERE, WAIT FOR PAUL
5702	False	Deeper {\em XMM} observation ({\color{red} xxx s exposure at the eFEDS coordinates}) reveals the X-ray emission is coming from a blue object in SDSS (which appears to be an AGN), XCS detects this as a point source 
6840	False	eFEDS candidate appears to be coincident with a blue source in SDSS (potentially an AGN). XCS detects {\em XMM} emission as a point source, again, coincident with the SDSS source.
